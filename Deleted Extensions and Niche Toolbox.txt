(2023/8/10)
Due to issues with rights and creditting, the following extensions were changed/deleted:

SharkPool's contributed Extensions:
-Time V2
-S-Grab V2

Extensions by others:
-Color at X&Y
-Sound to Data.URI

Thank you to the original creators for these extensions for their contributions to the gallery and Turbowarp :)

I understand your fustration about the removal of these extensions, but luckily theres good news:

-Blocks/Functions made by SharkPool in Time and S-Grab V2 are kept in the extension, but blocks made by original creators were removed. (They remain creddited)
-Niche Toolbox features the blocks from Color at X&Y and Sound to Data.URI (thank you @Oznzw)
