How to Add YOUR Extension to SharkPool's Extension Collection

Step-By-Step Tutorial

Step 1: Make Your Extension

Step 2: Make a Thumbnail for Your Extension

-Rule 1: It MUST be 300x150 pixel SVG
-Rule 2: It MUST have a curved outline bordering the thumbnail (Same as the other Extensions)

Step 3: Add your Extension Code and Extension Thumbnail to the 'extension-code' and 'extension-thumbs' folder on Github

(https://github.com/SharkPool-SP/SharkPools-Extensions/tree/main/extension-code)
(https://github.com/SharkPool-SP/SharkPools-Extensions/tree/main/extension-thumbs)

Step 4: Edit and Add to the Extension Keys JSON

(https://github.com/SharkPool-SP/SharkPools-Extensions/blob/main/Gallery%20Files/Extension%20Keys.json)
-Rule 1: Under the 'extensions' key, you need to add a new sub-key right before the 'example' extension
-Rule 2: Format it like this, replace the [] with your links/text:

    "[Extension-Name]": {
      "credits": "[A Short Credits Text for your Extension]",
      "url": "[Link to the RAW FILE for your Extension Code]",
      "tags": "[Tags that Relate to your Extension]"
    }

-Sub Rule 1: Extension Name MUST NOT include spaces, use '-' instead
-Sub Rule 2: Tags MUST start with '.all'
-Sub Rule 3: Tags MUST be split by '.' and MUST be from this list:
	
	Possible Tags:
	-'utilities' -> Utility Blocks
	-'expanded' -> Expansion of existing Custom/Vanilla Extension
	-'fetching' -> Extensions that use 'fetch' or anything related to it

Note: Dont worry about the Extension Thumbnail as they are Automatically Loaded

Step 5: Pull Request and You're Done!

Note: Remember to include all files and changes (SVG Thumbnail, Extension Code, and JSON additions: RAW Code Link, Credits, Name, Tags))
